Allows Shop Owners to create or edit existing coupons for WooCommerce that will only work on set days of the week.

== Description ==

This plugin allows Shop Owners to create coupons for WooCommerce which will only work on set days of the week.

It adds an extra section to the ‘Usage Limits’ tab when editing a WooCommerce coupon, and displays an extra 7 checkboxes so a User can choose exactly when a promotional offer is valid. This way a Shop Owner can run promotions on days when trade is less busy, or multiple promotions for different days of the week.

The plugin then will perform an additional check when a customer tries a coupon, and returns a helpful message if the coupon is not available for the current day.

= Usage =

After installing and activating the plugin, just edit any existing coupon - The Usage Limits tab will now have new options to choose which days of the week the coupon is valid for. If all checkboxes are left blank, the coupon will work as usual.

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Woo Daily Options” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading this plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

The full files are available on wordpress.org, or from [GitHub](https://github.com/jakewhiteley/woocommerce-daily-coupons/).
